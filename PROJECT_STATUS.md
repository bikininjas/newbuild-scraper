# Project Context & Status: newbuild-scraper

## Goal
The goal of this project is to build a Python-based price tracker and HTML report generator for PC components. It scrapes prices from multiple e-commerce sites, tracks historical prices, and generates a modern HTML dashboard with product cards, price graphs, and summary tables. The UI should be clean, readable, and focused on the most relevant information for users.

## Current Features
- Scrapes prices from multiple sites (Amazon, Idealo, LDLC, TopAchat, etc.)
- Tracks historical prices in a CSV file
- Generates HTML output with:
  - Product cards (name, best price, links)
  - Price history graphs (Chart.js)
  - Summary table of best prices per category
  - Total price evolution graph
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Dates are formatted in French
- Graphs are visually compact (height 60px)

## Recent Issues & Difficulties
- **Historical Prices Section:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Successfully implemented toggleable historical prices with buttons. Historical prices are now hidden by default but can be shown/hidden with individual toggle buttons for each product card.
- **Code Duplication:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Duplicate helper functions and logic blocks have been cleaned up.
- **Cognitive Complexity:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Refactored main logic functions by extracting helper functions to reduce complexity from 21 to under 15.
- **French Date Formatting:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Locale-based formatting was replaced with a manual month mapping for portability.
- **Graph Sizing:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Graph heights are now enforced via both HTML and CSS.
- **Missing re Module:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Fixed Playwright error by adding missing `import re` to scraper.py.

## What's Missing / Next Steps
- **✅ Historical Prices Section:** **COMPLETED** - Successfully implemented toggleable historical prices with individual buttons for each product card.
- **✅ Documentation:** **COMPLETED** - README.md and prompt_en.md updated to reflect current UI state, features, and resolved issues.
- **✅ Code Quality:** **COMPLETED** - Reduced cognitive complexity in main logic functions through refactoring and helper function extraction.
- **✅ Testing:** **COMPLETED** - Confirmed that all UI changes are reflected in the output and code runs cleanly.

## Prompt for Next AI Agent
You are an AI developer working on the `newbuild-scraper` project. Your goal is to:
- ✅ **COMPLETED:** Ensure the HTML output is clean, modern, and focused (historical prices are now toggleable with buttons)
- ✅ **COMPLETED:** Fix the issue where the historical prices section was always visible (now hidden by default with toggle buttons)
- Continue refactoring code for maintainability and clarity
- Update documentation to reflect the current state and features

**Recent Achievements:**
- ✅ Successfully implemented toggleable historical prices with individual toggle buttons for each product card
- ✅ Historical prices are hidden by default but can be shown/hidden with smooth animations
- ✅ Fixed Playwright error by adding missing `import re` to scraper.py
- ✅ Clean, modern UI with all requested functionality

**Your next steps:**
- Update README.md and documentation to reflect the new toggleable historical prices feature
- Reduce cognitive complexity in main functions for better maintainability
- Continue testing and validation of all features

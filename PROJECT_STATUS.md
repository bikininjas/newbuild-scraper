# Project Context & Status: newbuild-scraper

## Goal
The goal of this project is to build a Python-based price tracker and HTML report generator for PC components. It scrapes prices from multiple e-commerce sites, tracks historical prices, and generates a modern HTML dashboard with product cards, price graphs, and summary tables. The UI should be clean, readable, and focused on the most relevant information for users.

## Current Features
- **Multi-site Price Scraping**: Scrapes prices from Amazon.fr, Idealo.fr, LDLC.com, TopAchat.com, Materiel.net
- **Anti-bot Protection**: Playwright-based scraping with stealth mode and site-specific behavior handling
- **Cookie Consent Management**: Automatic handling of consent popups (especially Idealo.fr)
- **Category-based Organization**: Products organized by categories (Mouse, Keyboard, PSU, RAM, SSD, GPU, Cooler, Motherboard, CPU, Upgrade Kit)
- **Smart Price Calculations**: Excludes "Upgrade Kit" items from total price calculations as they represent alternatives to individual components
- **Historical Price Tracking**: Stores price history in CSV format with timestamps
- **Modern HTML Dashboard**:
  - Product cards with best prices and visual indicators for alternative products
  - Toggleable historical price sections (hidden by default)
  - Interactive price history graphs (Chart.js, 60px height)
  - Summary table of best prices per category
  - Total price evolution graph (excluding upgrade kits)
  - Yellow warning boxes for alternative/upgrade kit products
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS styling with French date formatting
- **Automated Workflows**: GitHub Actions for scheduled scraping and GCS deployment

## Recent Issues & Difficulties

- **Historical Prices Section:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Successfully implemented toggleable historical prices with buttons. Historical prices are now hidden by default but can be shown/hidden with individual toggle buttons for each product card.
- **Code Duplication:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Duplicate helper functions and logic blocks have been cleaned up.
- **Cognitive Complexity:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Refactored main logic functions by extracting helper functions to reduce complexity from 21 to under 15.
- **French Date Formatting:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Locale-based formatting was replaced with a manual month mapping for portability.
- **Graph Sizing:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Graph heights are now enforced via both HTML and CSS.
- **Missing re Module:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Fixed Playwright error by adding missing `import re` to scraper.py.
- **Upgrade Kit Pricing Issue:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Excluded "Upgrade Kit" category from total price calculations as they represent alternatives to individual components, not additional costs.
- **Idealo Cookie Consent:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Implemented automatic cookie consent handling for Idealo.fr to improve price extraction success rates.
- **Visual Product Differentiation:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Added yellow warning boxes to clearly identify upgrade kit/alternative products in the HTML output.


## What's Missing / Next Steps

- **✅ Historical Prices Section:** **COMPLETED** - Successfully implemented toggleable historical prices with individual buttons for each product card.
- **✅ Upgrade Kit Exclusion:** **COMPLETED** - Upgrade kits are now excluded from total price calculations and visually distinguished with warning indicators.
- **✅ Cookie Consent Handling:** **COMPLETED** - Automatic Idealo.fr cookie consent handling implemented for better price extraction.
- **✅ Documentation:** **COMPLETED** - README.md and prompt_en.md updated to reflect current UI state, features, and resolved issues.
- **✅ Code Quality:** **COMPLETED** - Reduced cognitive complexity in main logic functions through refactoring and helper function extraction.
- **✅ Testing:** **COMPLETED** - Confirmed that all UI changes are reflected in the output and code runs cleanly.

## Current Branch Status

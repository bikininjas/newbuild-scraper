# Project Context & Status: newbuild-scraper

## Goal
The goal of this project is to build a Python-based price tracker and HTML report generator for PC components. It scrapes prices from multiple e-commerce sites, tracks historical prices, and generates a modern HTML dashboard with product cards, price graphs, and summary tables. The system supports advanced vendor extraction from aggregator sites and now uses a JSON-based product declaration (`products.json`) replacing the former CSV loader (CSV kept only for backward compatibility exports).

## Current Features
- **Multi-site Price Scraping**: Scrapes prices from Amazon.fr, Idealo.fr, LDLC.com, TopAchat.com, Materiel.net, PCComponentes.es
- **Advanced Idealo Integration**: 
  - Multi-strategy vendor extraction from aggregator results
  - Redirect following to actual vendor websites for direct price collection
  - Amazon marketplace and Prime eligibility detection
  - Enhanced cookie consent handling with iframe detection
- **Anti-bot Protection**: Playwright-based scraping with stealth mode and site-specific behavior handling
- **Database Support**: 
  - SQLite database with enhanced schema supporting vendor information
  - JSON-driven product declaration (`products.json`) as single source of truth
- **Category-based Organization**: Products organized by categories (Mouse, Keyboard, PSU, RAM, SSD, GPU, Cooler, Motherboard, CPU, Upgrade Kit)
- **Smart Price Calculations**: Excludes "Upgrade Kit" items from total price calculations as they represent alternatives to individual components
- **Historical Price Tracking**: Enhanced database schema with vendor details, marketplace status, and Prime eligibility
- **Modern HTML Dashboard**:
  - Product cards with vendor information and marketplace indicators
  - Toggleable historical price sections (hidden by default)
  - Interactive price history graphs (Chart.js, 60px height)
  - Summary table of best prices per category with vendor details
  - Total price evolution graph (excluding upgrade kits)
  - Yellow warning boxes for alternative/upgrade kit products
  - Single-file HTML output with inlined JavaScript (no external static assets)
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS styling with French date formatting
- **Automated Workflows**: GitHub Actions for scheduled scraping and GCS deployment
- **Product Management**: JSON (`products.json`) driven non-destructive import (adds new products/URLs) with duplicate detection and failed URL tracking (legacy CSV export still available)

## Recent Enhancements

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Idealo Vendor Extraction System
- **Multi-Strategy Vendor Detection**: Implemented 4-tier extraction system using data-shop-name attributes, logo analysis, text pattern matching, and domain detection
- **Enhanced Database Schema**: Added vendor_name, vendor_url, is_marketplace, is_prime_eligible fields to price_history table
- **Cookie Consent Framework**: Comprehensive handling for Idealo, Amazon, Corsair, and other vendor-specific consent dialogs
- **Redirect Following**: Automatic following of Idealo redirects to extract prices directly from vendor websites
- **Amazon Integration**: Specialized parsing for Amazon marketplace status, Prime eligibility, and accurate price extraction
- **Production Testing**: Successfully validated with real vendor extraction showing "Amazon.fr - 109‚Ç¨ (Prime)" results

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Database and Product Management
- **SQLite Backend**: Consolidated architecture (CSV mode removed)
- **Product Loading System**: JSON non-destructive import (adds new products/URLs, never deletes)
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Smart detection of existing products to prevent database bloat
- **Failed URL Tracking**: Comprehensive logging and handling of problematic URLs
- **Product Declaration**: Canonical `products.json` (versioned) for explicit product/category/URL mapping

### üõ†Ô∏è TopAchat URL Fix & Workflow

**TopAchat URL Format:**
Use full canonical TopAchat URLs inside each product's `urls` list in `products.json`, e.g.:
<https://www.topachat.com/pages/detail2_cat_est_micro_puis_rubrique_est_w_ssd_puis_ref_est_in20023645.html>

**JSON Workflow:**
1. (Optional) Backup DB: `cp data/scraper.db data/scraper_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).db`
2. Edit `products.json` (add/remove URLs)
3. Run `python src/main.py` (imports new products/urls)
4. Review logs / issues summary
5. Iterate

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Project Organization and Documentation
- **Test Cleanup**: Removed all debugging scripts and test CSV files for production readiness
- **Documentation Updates**: Enhanced README.md with Idealo integration details and technical architecture
- **Workflow Integration**: Product loader integrated into main scraper for seamless operation
- **Development Workflow**: Clear separation between development testing and production system

# ðŸ›’ Price Scraper Project (2025)

## Overview

This project tracks prices for computer parts (or any products) across multiple e-commerce sites. It automatically finds the best price for each product, logs price history, and generates a modern HTML dashboard with graphs and tables. All logic is modular and easy to extend.

## Code Structure

All HTML generation logic is now modularized:

- `src/htmlgen/data.py`: Loads products and price history from CSV files
- `src/htmlgen/normalize.py`: Price normalization, category mapping, and site label helpers
- `src/htmlgen/render.py`: Renders summary tables and product cards
- `src/htmlgen/graph.py`: Renders Chart.js price history graphs for all products
- `src/generate_html.py`: Main entry point, orchestrates data loading and rendering using the above modules

To add new features or fix bugs, edit the relevant module. All scripts are auto-formatted with `black`.

### How to extend

- Add new product categories in `normalize.py`
- Change table/card layout in `render.py`
- Update graph logic in `graph.py`

### Refactored Output

The generated HTML now includes:
- Category summary table (cheapest product per category)
- Total price history graph (Chart.js)
- Product cards grid (all prices, best price, history)
- Individual price history graphs for each product (Chart.js)

### How the graphs work

- **Total Price History graph:** Shows the sum of the best price for each product at each timestamp. The last point always matches the sum of the absolute best prices in the table.
- **Product Price History graph:** Shows the best price (lowest) for each product at each timestamp.

### Known Issues / To Fix

- If a product's best price is not present at every timestamp, the graph may show flat or stepped lines. This is expected.
- If a product is missing from the price history at a timestamp, it is excluded from the sum for that timestamp.
- The UI and CSV parsing are robust, but edge cases (e.g., malformed CSV, missing columns) may need more error handling.
- Cognitive complexity warnings in some functions (see lint output) should be refactored for maintainability.

## How to Use

### 1. Prepare your environment

- Install Python 3.10+ (or newer)
- Install Chrome/Chromium for Selenium (or use a compatible driver)
- Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 2. Fill your product list

- Edit `produits.csv` like this:

  ```csv
  URL,Product_Name
  https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B07W7L4RBX/,"Logitech G G502 X LIGHTSPEED"
  https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0DKFMSMYK/,"RYZEN â„¢ 7 9800X3D 8 Coeurs/16 Threads"
  https://www.pccomponentes.fr/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-processeur-42-ghz-96-mo-l3-boite,"RYZEN â„¢ 7 9800X3D 8 Coeurs/16 Threads"
  ...
  ```

- Add as many URLs as you want for each product (just repeat the product name)

### 3. Run locally

- Set the Discord webhook (if you want alerts):

  ```bash
  export DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL='your_webhook_url'
  ```

- Run the script:

  ```bash
  python src/main.py
  ```

- See the best price, all prices, and price history for each product in your console

- To generate a modern HTML report with all products styled as Tailwind cards:

  ```bash
  python src/generate_html.py
  ```

### 4. Run automatically with GitHub Actions

- Add your webhook to GitHub Actions secrets as `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`
- Push your code to GitHub
- The workflow in `.github/workflows/main.yml` will run every 4 hours and update `historique_prix.csv` automatically

      - name: Format HTML generator scripts
        run: black src/htmlgen/data.py src/htmlgen/normalize.py src/htmlgen/render.py src/htmlgen/graph.py src/generate_html.py

          git add -A  # Stage all changes (including formatted scripts)

          git diff --cached --quiet || git commit -m "Update price history and format scripts"
